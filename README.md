## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements like Header, Main, Section, and Footer
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](./Assets/01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png)

> **Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px. Eventually you'll learn how to make elements responsive so that your web application is optimized for any screen size.

**Notes**: I have made changes like changing div to HTML Semantic elements. I have used header, main, section, footer so that it is well structured and accessiblae to disable person. In the CSS section I have organized by complying different class into same section as they have all the requirements same. Like most of the classes had pixels, width, dispaly same, but they were scarattered everywhere in an unorganized manner. I've organized classes having same properites in one class. In some seciton I've changed classed into Id so that there is not to many class.
